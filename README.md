* The game consists of 10 turns. On each turn, the player has 2 chances to throw the ball to knock down all 10 pins 
* The score for each turn is the total number of pins knocked down, plus extra points for strikes 
* If the player knocks down all 10 pins on the first throwing of the turn, he makes a strike and does not need to make the second roll of the turn. The score for this turn is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in subsequent ball throws
